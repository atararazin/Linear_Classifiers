# Linear_Classifiers

We ran linear classifiers on the Abalone age prediction dataset. The classifiers we used - Perceptron, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and
Passive Aggresive.

Since the data isn't linearly seperable, we got accuracy rates of 55%-60%.

## How to Run the Program:
The program runs on python. It receives the data files as parameters to main in the following order: 

```(train_x.txt train_y.txt test_x.txt test_y.txt)```

Aside from the default files, I uploaded 4 more train files.
